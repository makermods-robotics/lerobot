    Configuration for the Metal arm leader teleoperator: 7 Damiao motors (6 joints + a permanent
    gripper) over classic CAN, driven via the stock `DamiaoMotorsBus`.

    Unlike OpenArms, the gripper is not optional (no `arm_end_type`): the leader always exposes all
    7 motors, all normalized in degrees. A background thread streams Pinocchio gravity-compensation
    MIT torque so the arm feels weightless while a human guides it; the gripper is left backdrivable
    (kp=0, torque=0) so it can be squeezed freely.
